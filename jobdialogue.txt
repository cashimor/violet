Hello, Violet. I was wondering if you'd be interested in a position here at my lair.

[label1] Yes, I’m curious.
[label2] No, I’m not interested.

Great! There are a few tasks I need help with.
?Would you prefer something with a bit of risk, or something more relaxed?

Alright, no worries. If you change your mind, let me know.

I like that attitude! We could really use your skills on a more adventurous task.

No problem. I’ll find something less intense for you.
