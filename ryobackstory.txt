start:
Ah, you’ve found me. Name’s Ryo. 
?What’s on your mind?
[label1] Tell me about your love.
[label2] You seem… particular.
[label3] Just browsing the area.
[talk] Let’s talk.

label1:
!neutral
I love money, in all its forms.
?It’s not just currency—it’s a record of ambition, effort, and success.
[label4] You must be great with finances.
[label5] Sounds a bit obsessive.

label2:
!neutral
Particular? I prefer refined.
For example, I can’t stand unpleasant odors.
?Honestly, if you ever want to scare me away, just bring something pungent.
[label6] That’s oddly specific.
[label7] You’d hate my cooking!

label3:
!neutral
Alright, well, I’ll be here if you want to talk money or strategy.

label4:
!neutral
Oh, absolutely.
I’ve kept books for businesses, counted coins for merchants,
and even turned debt into profit.
It’s not about greed—it’s about making order from chaos.

label5:
!neutral
Obsessive? Ha, maybe. But in this world, obsession often wins.
You can call it what you want, but I’ll keep counting.

label6:
!neutral
It’s not just specific—it’s survival.
Some smells just... distract me too much to think.
?Keep your air clean, and I’m at my best.

label7:
!neutral
Ha! Well, as long as I don’t have to smell it, I’ll be fine.
Let’s just keep business and cooking separate, shall we?
