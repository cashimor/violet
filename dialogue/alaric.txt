start:
Yes, Violet. I have come to take our child. Your evil manipulation forced my hands.
My wife is barren, and we need an heir, and since you drugged me and tricked me,
it is only fair that I now take my child back to live a better life.
?Your castle is a snake pit in the desert, and will be eradicated next.
[confront] How dare you take my child?
[plead] Please, Alaric, don’t do this.
[question] My body knows you loved it. You loved me.
[skip] <skip>

confront:
!angry
Your child? Is that what you’re calling him now? After everything you’ve done?
This is my child. And soon will be my wife's child.
He will be named Seren.
?And you will no longer stain this desert with your presence.
[defend] I did what I had to. 
[deny] This isn’t about me!
[leave] ...

defend:
No. You did what you *chose* to do.
You imprisoned me. Drugged me. Tricked me into believing you were my wife.
All because of your snake-like ambition and need for revenge.
?And now you’ll see how it feels to lose everything.
[knew] You knew it was me!
[leave] ...

knew:
I'm sure you remember the moment I knew it was you too.
Vaeren! Kill her!

deny:
Isn’t it? Violet, it has *always* been about you.
Your pride, your vengeance, your endless hunger for control.
Vaeren! Kill her!

plead:
You don’t understand. This isn’t just about us anymore.
?I have to protect Seren from you.
[soften] You think I’d hurt my own child? 
[accuse] You’re no better than me!

soften:
I think you’d do anything to win, Violet.
Even if it means destroying the people you love.
Vaeren! Kill her!

accuse:
I know I’m not. But someone has to break this cycle. Someone has to stop the madness.
Vaeren! Kill her!

question:
You were a serpent from the first day we met.
I would've been dead already had we married, my lands taken by your father.
You are beautiful, but even more deadly.
?And the drug made me think you were my wife. What you felt was my love for her.
[justify] You don’t know what I went through! 
[remorse] Maybe you’re right... 
[defiant] You can’t stop me.

justify:
And yet I would have never done this to you.
You don’t see it, do you?
The endless path of destruction you leave behind.
Vaeren! Kill her!

remorse:
If you really believe that, Violet, then let Seren go.
Prove to me there’s something left in you worth saving.
Vaeren...

defiant:
That’s where you’re wrong. I’ve already won, Violet.
Vaeren! Kill her!
