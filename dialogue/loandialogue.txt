?What should we do about this?
[ignore] Let's ignore it for now.

I don't think I can do that. We have to get our money back.

Definitely. We will find him tonight.

scenario1:
!serious
?One of the debtors is avoiding payment. How should I handle this?
[train_success] Appear at their home during dinner

[train_fail] Demand weekly interest payments
[train_success] Create a sense of urgency
[train_fail] Send a stern letter

scenario3:
!smirk
?One debtor is offering their family heirloom as collateral. Should we accept it?
[train_fail] Refuse
[train_fail] Accept
[train_success] Take it, but undervalue it

[train_fail] Outright threats are the way to go. Fear is the greatest motivator!
