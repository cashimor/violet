Violet!
!excited
Oh my goodness, it's really you!
?I can't believe we're in the same world again!
[greeting1] Nys... what are you doing here?
[greeting2] Why now, Nys? Why couldn't you stay away?
[greeting3] You look... unchanged, as usual

greeting1:
!cheerful
Oh, you know me, always finding a way to you!
I met this snake woman who taught me to speak bester.
And then I was in someone's tiny tiny room filled with weird things.
He was very nice though, and let me stay there.
?Poof! Here I am! Isn’t it wonderful?
[response1] Wonderful isn’t the word I’d use
[response2] I guess that means you're stuck here too
[response3] How was home?

response1:
!pout
Aww, don’t be mean! I missed you so much!
?And now we can spend all our time together again.
[change1] I suppose that’s... nice, in a way
[change2] Just don’t get in my way, Nys

response2:
!smile
Stuck? No way! This place is so exciting!
Everything’s so shiny and new. Haven't seen castles yet, though. Or wyverns.
?Or... oh! What about knights?
[change3] There’s none of that, Nys
[change4] Focus, Nys. This isn’t a fairy tale

response3:
!neutral
Not good. That evil prince Alaric came and took our castle.
I was given only four meals a day. And I had to go out in the sun sometimes.
?But now I am here with you, my sister! Much better.
[change5] You really need to stop being so... dramatic
[change6] I suppose I should feel flattered.

change1:
!smile
That’s the spirit, Violet! We’re going to have so much fun together!
>end

change2:
!excited
Don’t worry, I’ll be super helpful!
Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it perfectly!
>end

change3:
!pout
"Oh. That sounds kind of boring. But you’re here, so it can’t be that bad!"
>end

change4:
!serious
Right! Got it. I’ll be the best helper ever! You’ll see!
>end

change5:
!pout
Dramatic? Me? You’re so mean, Violet! I’m just trying to help.
>end

change6:
!cheerful
You should! I’ve always been your number one fan!
>end
