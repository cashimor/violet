Violet!
${Itsuki/injail:>itsukijail:!excited}
${dumb:>second:Oh my goodness, it's really you!}
?I can't believe we're in the same world again!
[greeting1] Nys... what are you doing here?
[greeting2] Why now, Nys? Why couldn't you stay away?
[greeting3] You look... unchanged, as usual

second:
!happy
?We meet again. As we should. Us sisters should be together always.
[response1] We should?
[response3] How was home?
[response7] You always think so highly of yourself
${seren::[askChild] My child?}

greeting1:
!cheerful
Oh, you know me, always finding a way to you!
I met this snake woman who taught me to speak bester.
And then I was in someone's tiny tiny room filled with weird things.
He was very nice though, and let me stay there.
?Poof! Here I am! Isn’t it wonderful?
[response1] Wonderful isn’t the word I’d use
[response2] I guess that means you're stuck here too
[response3] How was home?
[askChild] My child?

response1:
!pout
Aww, don’t be mean! I missed you so much!
?And now we can spend all our time together again.
[change1] I suppose that’s... nice, in a way
[change2] Just don’t get in my way, Nys

response2:
!smile
Stuck? No way! This place is so exciting!
Everything’s so shiny and new. Haven't seen castles yet, though. Or wyverns.
?Or... oh! What about knights?
[change3] There’s none of that, Nys
[change4] Focus, Nys. This isn’t a fairy tale

response3:
!neutral
Not good. That evil prince Alaric came and took our castle.
I was given only four meals a day. And I had to go out in the sun sometimes.
?But now I am here with you, my sister! Much better.
[change5] You really need to stop being so... dramatic
[change6] I suppose I should feel flattered.

change1:
!smile
@checkEvil(75)

checkEvilFalse:
That’s the spirit, Violet! We’re going to have so much fun together!
>end

change2:
!excited
Don’t worry, I’ll be super helpful!
Just tell me what to do, and I’ll do it perfectly!
>end

change3:
!pout
"Oh. That sounds kind of boring. But you’re here, so it can’t be that bad!"
>end

change4:
!serious
Right! Got it. I’ll be the best helper ever! You’ll see!
>end

change5:
!pout
Dramatic? Me? You’re so mean, Violet! I’m just trying to help.
>end

change6:
!cheerful
You should! I’ve always been your number one fan!

@setTidbit(dumb)

greeting2:
!pout
Stay away? Violet, how could you say that? I came here because I missed you!
?We’re supposed to be together! And I kind of couldn't help it.
[response4] We don’t always need to be together, Nys
[response5] I suppose I can’t change your mind
[response6] You’re impossible, Nys
[askChild] My child?

greeting3:
!cheerful
Unchanged? Oh, Violet, you’re too kind! You still look as radiant as ever!
Although your senseo of fashion... is still the same.
?Are we going to rule this world together?
[response7] You always think so highly of yourself
[response8] You should focus on surviving first
[response9] Rule the world? Don’t get ahead of yourself
[askChild] My child?

response4:
!neutral
But I do! You’re my sister, Violet.
?I couldn’t just sit around while you were off somewhere.
[change7] You always overthink things, Nys
[change8] I guess I should be grateful

response5:
!cheerful
Nope! And I don’t regret it for a second.
?This world is already better because you’re in it.
[change9] You really do live in your own world, don’t you?
[change10] At least you’re optimistic

response6:
!pout
?Impossible? I prefer to think of it as determined. You’re lucky to have me, Violet.
[change11] Lucky isn’t the word I’d use
[change12] Let’s see how this goes

response7:
!smile
Well, someone has to think highly of me! And if it’s not me, then who?
?Certainly not you, with that tone.
[change13] Some things never change, Nys
[change14] Let’s keep things grounded, shall we?

response8:
!serious
Surviving first? That doesn’t sound like you, Violet. You’re always so confident.
?What’s going on?
[change15] I’m just being realistic
[change16] You wouldn’t understand

response9:
!excited
Not yet, but soon, right? You always have a plan, Violet.
?I’ll be your second-in-command!
[change17] Don’t get ahead of yourself, Nys
[change18] We’ll see

change7:
!neutral
Well, maybe. But someone has to overthink if we’re going to survive this crazy place!
>end

change8:
!smile
You should! You’re lucky to have a sister like me.
>end

change9:
!neutral
Maybe, but it’s a nice world to live in! You should try it sometime.
>end

change10:
!cheerful
Exactly! That’s what sisters are for, right?
>end

change11:
!neutral
Well, I think you’re wrong. But you’ll see—I’ll prove it to you!
>end

change12:
!smile
Good! Let’s make the best of it together.
>end

change13:
!smile
And why should they? You’re always so serious. I’ll lighten things up for you.
>end

change14:
!neutral
Grounded? That sounds boring, but fine. You lead the way, Violet.
>end

change15:
!neutral
Realistic? Since when are you that? You’ve always been larger than life!
>end

change16:
!pout
Why wouldn’t I? I’m your sister! I can understand more than you think.
>end

change17:
!excited
Okay, okay. I’ll wait. But it’s going to be amazing, just wait and see!
>end

change18:
!smile
We’ll see? That’s practically a yes! I can’t wait!
>end

askChild:
!curious
Your child? Oh, Violet, I didn’t even know you had one!
?You always kept things so secretive. What were they like?
[childResponse1] I asked you
[childResponse2] You'd know him as Alaric's child

childResponse1:
!cheerful
True... but I don't know.
>end

childResponse2:
@setTidbit(seren)

seren:
!shock
So his eyes... are YOUR eyes? Everyone chatted about how his mother slept around.
But instead it was Alaric that...
!disgust
Ew! you... How could you? Anyway. He's called Seren. And he is horrendous.
!angry
He wield this mean sword. And came and destroyed our ancestral home.
All my sisters, and me, had to live like servants.
>end

itsukijail:
!shock
?Itsuki is in jail! Please! Help me get them out!
[noworry] Don't worry
[join] You could join me
[bail] You should bail him out

noworry:
!sad
I'm not worried. Itsuki will be back, right?

bail:
!ponder
Bail? I... will have to figure that out.

checkEvilTrue:
?Is there something we can do together?
[chat] We can chat more
[join] You could join me

chat:
!happy
Of course. I'd love that.

join:
!cheerful
Nys: Oh my gosh, Violet! Are you really asking me to join your big, mysterious lair?
Like, actually asking me? I’m so excited! You sure there is space for me?
@selectJob(Evil Lair)

selectJobFail:
!pout
Aw... I don't think I want to share, Violet. But it was a nice thought.
