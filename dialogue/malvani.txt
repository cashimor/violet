?Ah, my dearest Violet. You’ve done well, better than I could have hoped.
[question1] Corrupting the city?
[question2] Why did you bring me here?
[question3] I need answers

question1:
!laugh
Corrupting? Oh no, Violet, don’t think of it that way.
You’re simply showing this world the truth. Strength wins, and the weak serve.
?You’re embodying the natural order.
[continue1] What do you want?
[resist1] I’m not interested

question2:
!serious
Why? Because you intrigued me. You, a woman of ambition, betrayed and discarded.
You had nothing, yet you dared to fight back.
?I gave you the opportunity to prove what you could do with true power.
[continue2] You want thanks?
[resist2] You ripped me from my life

question3:
!frown
Answers, you say? Very well.
?Ask your questions, but know this—my answers may not bring you the peace you seek.
[continue3] What’s your goal in all this?
[resist3] Enough riddles

continue1:
!smile
What do I want? I want you to thrive, Violet.
The more you rise, the stronger I become. Our fates are intertwined.
?You are my champion, after all.
[end1] Think
[end2] I'm no pawn

continue2:
!grin
Gratitude is not what I seek. I want results, Violet.
Every step you take towards domination feeds my essence.
?You see, you’re not just my creation—you’re my partner.
[end3] It feels one-sided
[end4] I'll show you

continue3:
!neutral
My goal is simple: to spread my influence,
to reshape this world into something worthy of me.
?And you, my dear Violet, are the keystone of this grand design.
[end5] Conquer the world
[end6] No

resist1:
!angry
Not interested? Oh, Violet, don’t fool yourself.
?You’ve already embraced the darkness. You just need to admit it.
[end7] You don't know
[end8] Yes, I will

resist2:
!laugh
Ripped away? Life? I gave you purpose, child.
Without me, you’d still be a victim of your past.
?Vaeren would've killed you. It is written.
[end9] Better dead than a pawn
[end10] I’ll play along

resist3:
!serious
?Manipulation? I merely illuminate paths for you to walk. You choose where to step.
[end11] I will walk my way
[end12] I will ask for more

end1:
!smile
Take your time, my champion. I will be watching. Always.

end2:
!angry
Pawn? You underestimate yourself, Violet. But very well, defy me if you must.
It will only delay the inevitable.

end3:
!neutral
Partnerships often feel that way at first.
Prove your worth, and my scales will tip in your favor.

end4:
!grin
That’s the spirit, my champion. Go forth and show this world what power truly means.

end5:
!laugh
Not just the world, my dear. I expect you to reshape existence itself.
Ambitious? Perhaps. But isn’t that what you crave?

end6:
!angry
Then walk away, Violet. But remember, without me, you are nothing.

end7:
!neutral
We shall see, Violet. We shall see.

end8:
!grin
Acceptance is the first step. Now go, and let your actions speak louder than words.

end9:
!serious
As you wish, but do not mistake this for freedom.
You are still bound to me in ways you cannot imagine.

end10:
!smile
A wise choice. I will be watching, Violet.
Prove your worth, and we shall prosper together.

end11:
!serious
Then go, Violet. But know this—you cannot escape me forever.

end12:
!grin
Ah, bargaining already? Very well, Violet.
Let us see how far you can push your limits.
