start:
Welcome to my humble abode, Violet.  
I don't know what Itsuki thought, but rescuing you... 
it took nearly everything I had.  
?I am drained now, though.  
[who] Who are you?  
[where] Where am I?  
[what] What happened?
[thank] Thank you for rescuing me.
[leave] Can I go now?  

who:
I am Nirvani, maybe a Goddess...
Once, I was revered by many. Now, I am forgotten.  
Except by Itsuki, and hopefully you...
?the smallest flickers of belief left in the world.  
[where] Where am I?  
[what] What happened?
[itsuki] Itsuki?  
[leave] Can I go now?  

where:
This is my sanctuary, hidden in the threads of reality.  
A place where the forgotten gods fade, waiting for a chance to act.  
?I brought you here because no other realm would have you.  
[who] Who are you?
[what] What happened?  
[leave] Can I go now?  

what:
Vaeren sought to end your life, and he would have succeeded.
Itsuki prayed to me to rescue you. I was silly. So I did.
I intervened... but it cost me dearly.
?Itsuki believes you still have a purpose, Violet.
[who] Who are you?  
[where] Where am I?  
[itsuki] Itsuki?
[leave] Can I go now?  

leave:
Leave? Violet, you misunderstand.  
You are here because I saved you. You are alive because of me.
I would think you might show more... gratitude.
But fine. I shall now bring you to the town where Itsuki lives.
Be kind, Violet. Itsuki may be your only ally.

itsuki:
Itsuki is a magnificent person, who believes in me, despite not knowing me.
Itsuki gave me all the strength I have. Most of which I used to rescue you.
Itsuki prayed for you to live.
I snatched you away before Vaeren could strangle you.
And now I'll send you to Itsuki. Be nice.

thank:
Oh. You should do more than be thankful, Violet.
I am counting on you.
I shall bring you to Itsuki, who prayed for you to be saved.
You got here before Vaeren could stangle you.
