start:
It's always a pleasure to see you here Violet. Hopefully we can talk.

lair1:
This lair of ours—it’s a curious place to plan one’s future. But...
?I wonder, is there something in your past you’d rather leave behind?
[father] My father.
[betrayal] Betrayal.
[nothing] Nothing.

nothing:
I see. I don't want to cause you distress. We can talk about it another time.
Let’s just rest together, for now. But if you ever want to talk, I’ll be here.

betrayal:
So this... Alaric... promised to marry you, even bought jewelry for you,
but then gave it all to a girl that his aunt arranged for him?
?Did you love him?
[love] I wanted him.
[ticket] He was my ticket out.
[kill] I would've killed him.
[nothing] None of your business.

love:
I see...

ticket:
So he used you, but you planned to use him too.
?It seems you might be even.
[child] He has my child.
[never] I am better than him.
${alaricEven:[never]:[even]} Perhaps...
[nothing] None of your business.

never:
I know you are.

even:
I'm glad to hear it.

child:
@setTidbit(hasChild)

hasChild:
Please... don't let this get you upset. We can talk more later.

kill:
You would have... yes... the moment you had a child. If not you, then your father.

father:
Your father only had daughters? And he wanted a son...
and you did all you could to be that son for him, but it didn't help.
Then he played you out against your sisters. So you all hated each other.
?Maybe you could tell me what you would tell your father now?
[father_why] Why talk now?
[father_laugh] You laughed at me with a sword.
[father_plead] I just wanted your love.
[father_hate] Why did you hate me?

father_why:
You were always my daughter.
?But you were never enough.
[father_fault] That is your fault.
[father_now] And now? Am I enough now?
[father_laugh] You laughed at me with a sword.
[nothing] I want to stop.

father_fault:
Maybe. But I did the best I could.

father_now:
You always were the strongest of my daughters. 
Even if I didn’t show it, I admired that strength.

father_laugh:
Perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps I should have seen you as you were—
stronger than I ever gave you credit for.
?My cruelty made you successful.
[father_no] I made me successful.
[father_plead] I just wanted your love.
[father_hate] Why did you hate me?
[nothing] I want to stop.

father_no:
!happy
Yes, you did.

father_plead:
Yes, you wanted me to be proud. I wanted a legacy.
?Was that so bad?
[father_proud] Yes! I was not that legacy.
[father_hate] Why did you hate me?
[nothing] I want to stop.

father_proud:
No. You were a mistake. I loved your mother the most.
But even she only gave me daughters.
Oh... he was such a mean father. I can see why you do the things you do.
It's best if we stop now.

father_hate:
Perhaps I didn't know how to notice. Perhaps I was afraid to.
I had a kingdom to rule.
?Maybe you should forgive yourself, even if you can't forgive me.
[father_unsure] I don't know if I can.
[father_forgive] I think so...
[father_no] Never!

father_no:
It's alright. You'll be alright, Violet.

father_unsure:
Yes... these things are difficult.
I am glad that you recognize the conflict inside you.

fatherEven:
@adjustEvilness(-10)

father_forgive:
That is good... if you mean it.

father_no:
I see... you still feel quite strongly about it.
Perhaps we can revisit it another time.

lair2:
In your old world, who did you want to be? And who are you now?
?If you could choose... which of those lives feels truer to you?
[queen] I wanted to be queen of the desert.
[ruler] I will be ruler of Kiyosawa.
[oldlife] I'd like to go back.
[newlife] I will stay here.

queen:
You would be a magnificent queen in any world.

ruler:
Certainly. The only question is what kind of ruler you will be.

oldlife:
You came here... you might be able to go back?
I believe it was the Goddess that brought you here. Perhaps you can ask her somehow?
@setTidbit(oldLife)

newlife:
I'm glad to hear that. I like you being here.
