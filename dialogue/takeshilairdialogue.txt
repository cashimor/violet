checkEvilTrue:
Violet, I can’t do this anymore.
I thought I could help you see a different path,
one that doesn’t hurt so many people.
But you’ve made it clear where your priorities lie.
I care about you, Violet. I really do. But staying ${here|at your lair}...
It’s breaking my soul.
?I can’t be part of this anymore.
[angry] Go, then! I don’t need you!
[desperate] You’re abandoning me? After everything?
[resigned] Fine. Leave. You’ll regret it
[keep] I won't let you

angry:
Maybe you don’t. But I hope someday, you’ll understand why I had to leave.
@scenarioStep(takeshileaves)

desperate:
I’m not abandoning you, Violet. You’re the one pushing me away.
I just… can’t stay and watch you destroy yourself.
@scenarioStep(takeshileaves)

resigned:
Maybe I will. But I’d regret staying even more.
@scenarioStep(takeshileaves)

keep:
What?! You can't do that!

!tiedup
Hhmmhmhhhmmmmmm!

checkEvilFalse:
?It's always a pleasure to see you here Violet. Hopefully we can talk.
[lair1] Of course
[lair2] It's hard
[lair3] Please be gentle
${Itsuki/injail:[police] Police:[nothing] Nothing}
${hasChild:[lair4] Alright?: }

lair1:
This lair of ours—it’s a curious place to plan one’s future. But...
?I wonder, is there something in your past you’d rather leave behind?
[father] My father
[betrayal] Betrayal
[nothing] Nothing

nothing:
I see. I don't want to cause you distress. We can talk about it another time.
Let’s just rest together, for now. But if you ever want to talk, I’ll be here.

betrayal:
So this... Alaric... promised to marry you, even bought jewelry for you,
but then gave it all to a girl that his aunt arranged for him?
?Did you love him?
[love] I wanted him
[ticket] He was my ticket out
[kill] I would've killed him
[nothing] None of your business

love:
I see...

ticket:
So he used you, but you planned to use him too.
?It seems you might be even.
[child] He has my child
[never] I am better than him
${alaricEven:[never]:[even]} Perhaps...
[nothing] None of your business

never:
I know you are.

even:
I'm glad to hear it.
@setTidbit(alaricEven)

alaricEven:
@adjustEvilness(-10)

child:
@setTidbit(hasChild)

hasChild:
Please... don't let this get you upset. We can talk more later.

kill:
You would have... yes... the moment you had a child. If not you, then your father.

father:
Your father only had daughters? And he wanted a son...
${fatherEven::>father_continue}

father_continue:
and you did all you could to be that son for him, but it didn't help.
Then he played you out against your sisters. So you all hated each other.
!father
?Maybe you could tell me what you would tell your father now?
[father_why] Why talk now?
[father_laugh] You laughed at me with a sword
[father_plead] I just wanted your love
[father_hate] Why did you hate me?

father_why:
You were always my daughter.
?But you were never enough.
[father_fault] That is your fault
[father_now] And now? Am I enough now?
[father_laugh] You laughed at me with a sword
[nothing] I want to stop

father_fault:
Maybe. But I did the best I could.

father_now:
You always were the strongest of my daughters. 
Even if I didn’t show it, I admired that strength.

father_laugh:
Perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps I should have seen you as you were—
stronger than I ever gave you credit for.
?My cruelty made you successful.
[father_no] I made me successful
[father_plead] I just wanted your love
[father_hate] Why did you hate me?
[nothing] I want to stop

father_no:
!happy
Yes, you did.

father_plead:
Yes, you wanted me to be proud. I wanted a legacy.
?Was that so bad?
[father_proud] Yes! I was not that legacy.
[father_hate] Why did you hate me?
[nothing] I want to stop

father_proud:
No. You were a mistake. I loved your mother the most.
But even she only gave me daughters.
!neutral
I'm sorry. I went too far. I can see why you do the things you do.
It's best if we stop now.

father_hate:
Perhaps I didn't know how to notice. Perhaps I was afraid to.
I had a kingdom to rule.
?Maybe you should forgive yourself, even if you can't forgive me.
[father_unsure] I don't know if I can
[father_forgive] I think so...
[father_no] Never!

father_no:
It's alright. You'll be alright, Violet.

father_unsure:
!neutral
Yes... these things are difficult.
I am glad that you recognize the conflict inside you.
@setTidbit(fatherEven)

fatherEven:
@adjustEvilness(-10)

father_forgive:
!neutral
That is good... if you mean it.

father_no:
!neutral
I see... you still feel quite strongly about it.
Perhaps we can revisit it another time.

lair2:
In your old world, who did you want to be? And who are you now?
?If you could choose... which of those lives feels truer to you?
[queen] I wanted to be queen of the desert
[ruler] I will be ruler of Kiyosawa
[oldlife] I'd like to go back
[newlife] I will stay here

queen:
You would be a magnificent queen in any world.

ruler:
Certainly. The only question is what kind of ruler you will be.

oldlife:
You came here... you might be able to go back?
I believe it was the Goddess that brought you here. Perhaps you can ask her somehow?
@setTidbit(oldLife)

newlife:
I'm glad to hear that. I like you being here.

lair3:
${itsuki:>alternate:Violet, there’s something I’ve been wondering.}
?How did you come to this world? Who brought you here?
[deflect3] Does it matter?
[story3] Someone prayed for me
[provoke3] Are you doubting my power?

deflect3:
!thoughtful
I suppose not. But the past always finds its way to the present.

provoke3:
!calm
Not at all. But power always has a source. I’m curious about yours.
?Should we leave it at that? Or will you tell me more?
[story] Someone prayed for me
[nothing3] That’s all you need to know

nothing3:
Very well. But secrets have a way of revealing themselves, Violet.

story3:
Interesting.
They must've had very strong convictions for a Goddess to hear their prayer.
Especially one that I didn't know about until I met you.
?Do you ever think about them? I'm sure they believed you'd change your life.
[guilt3] I took everything from him
[indifference3] People come and go
[defensive3] Why should I care?

guilt3:
!sad
And yet they prayed for you. They must have seen something in you.
?Do you remember their name?
[itsuki3] Itsuki
[wrong3] Katsuki
[wrong3] Itsuro
[wrong3] I don't remember

itsuki3:
@setTidbit(itsuki)

itsuki:
I think it is time you find this Itsuki, and see if you can make amends.
I'm sure your minions will locate his apartment soon.
@adjustEvilness(-10)

wrong3:
It will come to you eventually, I'm sure.

indifference3:
Perhaps. But not everyone forgets so easily.

defensive3:
!serious
And what did you deserve, Violet? A new world? A second chance?

lair4:
${childpeace:>alternate:You mentioned... you have a child.}
That must have been difficult for you.
?Would you like to tell me more?
[child_yes] Yes, I’ll talk
[child_no] No. It’s none of your business

child_no:
I understand. It’s personal.
I won’t press you—just know I’m here if you need to talk.

child_yes:
So this child... did you leave them behind when you came to this world?
?What was it like for you?
[child_mother] I would've been a good mother
[child_legacy] They were my legacy
[child_burden] They were a burden I didn’t need
[nothing4] I don’t want to talk about this anymore

nothing4:
I understand. We can stop here.

child_mother:
A good mother...
even when the world treated you so cruelly, you still gave them love?
That’s something remarkable, Violet.
>child_continue

child_legacy:
Your legacy... Did you see yourself in them? Did you want them to be like you?
?What would you want for them now?
[child_success] I want them to succeed
[child_power] I want them to be powerful
[child_survive] I just want them to survive

child_success:
Success... not defined by this cruel world, I hope. But by something better.
Something they can choose.
>child_continue

child_power:
Power... Is that what they need to survive in the world you left?
Or is it what you need to survive here?
>child_continue

child_survive:
Survival... I suppose that’s where everything begins. And perhaps... ends.
>child_continue

child_burden:
A burden? I see. Even so, their existence ties you to something bigger than yourself.
Doesn’t it?
>child_continue

child_continue:
?Do you regret leaving them?
[child_regret] I do
[child_no_regret] No
[alaric4] Alaric took my child

child_regret:
Regret... That’s a heavy thing to carry.
Maybe one day, you’ll have the chance to make peace with it.
@setTidbit(childpeace)

childpeace:
@adjustEvilness(-10)

child_no_regret:
I see. Perhaps that is your way of surviving, Violet. To keep going forward.

alaric4:
${alaricEven:I thought you felt you were even with him.:I know. He will always be there.}
But there's no need to think about him anymore. Your child is more important.
You are more important.

alternate:
It is always good to see you here and hear your voice. But we can also just rest.
