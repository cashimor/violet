opt1:
!cheerful
This is so cool! An actual lair, like something out of a storybook!
Do I get my own secret code name? Oh! Can I be 'Shadow Whisper'?

opt2:
!neutral
Wait, what exactly do I *do* here?
Are we, like, plotting world domination,
or is this more of a 'take over the local bake sale' kind of thing?

opt3:
!excited
${GLOBAL/KNOWkaraoke:Do you think we could add a karaoke machine in here?:We should have a bard here too.}
I bet evil sounds way more intimidating with a good theme song. Just saying!

opt4:
!cheerful
You know, Violet, I always knew you were destined for greatness.
I mean, not *exactly* this, but still! Go big or go home, right?

opt5:
!serious
Oh! I should get to work, huh? What’s my job? Am I, like, your second-in-command?
Your spy? Your... um... snacks coordinator?

opt6:
!smile
Don’t worry, I’ll do my best! Well, my best-ish. You know how I am. 
But I’ll definitely try not to mess things up too badly!

itsukijail:
!shock
?Itsuki is in jail! Please! Help me get him out!
[noworry] Don't worry
[bail] You should bail him out
[fix] I'll fix that

noworry:
!sad
I'm not worried. He'll be back, won't he?

bail:
!ponder
Bail? I... will have to figure that out.

fix:
!happy
Oh! Thank you sis! You're the bestest.
