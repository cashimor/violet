opt1:
!cheerful
This is so cool! An actual lair, like something out of a storybook!
Do I get my own secret code name? Oh! Can I be 'Shadow Whisper'?
>continue

opt2:
!neutral
Wait, what exactly do I *do* here?
Are we, like, plotting world domination,
or is this more of a 'take over the local bake sale' kind of thing?
>continue

opt3:
!excited
${GLOBAL/KNOWkaraoke:Do you think we could add a karaoke machine in here?:We should have a bard here too.}
I bet evil sounds way more intimidating with a good theme song. Just saying!
>continue

opt4:
!cheerful
You know, Violet, I always knew you were destined for greatness.
I mean, not *exactly* this, but still! Go big or go home, right?
>continue

opt5:
!serious
Oh! I should get to work, huh? What’s my job? Am I, like, your second-in-command?
Your spy? Your... um... snacks coordinator?
>continue

opt6:
!smile
Don’t worry, I’ll do my best! Well, my best-ish. You know how I am. 
But I’ll definitely try not to mess things up too badly!
>continue

continue:
?What are we doing next?
[relax] We relax
${GLOBAL/SHOP_karaokeMachine:[karaoke] We could do karaoke::}

relax:
Sounds fun!

itsukijail:
!shock
?Itsuki is in jail! Please! Help me get him out!
[noworry] Don't worry
[bail] You should bail him out
[fix] I'll fix that

noworry:
!sad
I'm not worried. He'll be back, won't he?

bail:
!ponder
Bail? I... will have to figure that out.

fix:
!happy
Oh! Thank you sis! You're the bestest.

karaoke:
!shock
That's quite the outfit Violet... But I'm not sure about this song title.
"Issa Dumb Song (And You're Smart)". You're not going to be mean, are you?
But let's sing...
