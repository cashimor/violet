s1m1: 
!curious
I was in a curious mood, trying to make sense of the world around me.
At the traffic light, I saw a bird repeatedly pecking at its reflection
in a car's side mirror.
?It got me thinking about why it was doing that.
[fail] Maybe it wanted a snack? 
${GLOBAL/KNOWcar:[success] It must think it's another bird.:[^CAR] car?}
[fail] Birds are so weird sometimes.

CAR:

s1m2: 
!frustrated
I was feeling frustrated, like everything was taking too long.
The traffic light stayed red for what felt like forever,
and the cars ahead didn’t move when it turned green.
?It was so annoying.
${GLOBAL/KNOWcar:[fail] Why not honk at them? :[^CAR] honk? car?}
${GLOBAL/KNOWlight:[success] Ugh, people need to pay attention. :[^LIGHT] traffic light?}
[fail] Maybe they were distracted?

LIGHT:

s1m3: 
!playful
I was in a playful mood, ready to find humor in the little things.
While waiting at the traffic light,
I noticed someone dancing in their car to the music.
?It made me smile.
[fail] Did you join them? 
${GLOBAL/KNOWcar:[success] That's hilarious!:[^CAR] car?}
[fail] People can be so silly.

s2m1: 
!thoughtful
I was in a thoughtful mood, considering every option carefully.
I was staring at the vending machine, debating between chocolate or chips.
?What would you pick?
${GLOBAL/KNOWvending:[success] Depends on your craving, right? :[^VENDING] Vending machine?}
[fail] Chocolate is always the answer!
[fail] Chips. Crunch is life.

VENDING:
~know/knowvending.txt

s2m2:
I felt like exploring something new, even if it was a small detour.
Walking home, I decided to try a new route through an unfamiliar alleyway.
?It seemed exciting.
[fail] Aren’t you worried about getting lost?
[success] Sounds like a fun little adventure.
[fail] I’d stick to the main roads.

s2m3:
I was in a pensive mood, pondering the lives of others.
In the park, I noticed three people chatting intently under a tree.
?It caught my attention.
[fail] They’re probably arguing over something silly.
[fail] Maybe they’re planning a party?
[success] What do you think their story is?

s3m1:
I was feeling adventurous today, ready to try something new.
At the coffee shop,
I couldn’t decide whether to stick to my usual drink or try something bold.
?What do you think I chose?
[success] You probably went for the bold choice—why not? 
[fail] The usual—comfort is key.
[fail] Maybe you skipped the coffee altogether?

s3m2: 
!reflective
I was in a reflective mood, thinking about how people adapt to challenges.
While waiting at the bus stop,
I noticed someone miss their bus and start laughing instead of getting upset.
?How would you react in their place?
${GLOBAL/KNOWcar:[success] I’d laugh too—sometimes that’s all you can do. :[^CAR] Bus?}
[fail] I’d probably get mad—missing the bus is annoying.
[fail] I wouldn’t care—it’s just a bus.

s3m3: 
I noticed a child blowing bubbles in the park—such a carefree moment.
?What do you think of it?
[fail] Seems like a pointless waste of time.
[success] It's simple, fleeting joy, isn't it?
[fail] I don’t get why anyone would find that fun.

s3m4:
I was in a playful mood, looking for little quirks to enjoy.
At the park, I saw a dog barking at its own reflection in a puddle.
?Isn’t that funny?
[success] Hilarious—dogs can be so silly!
[fail] Kind of, but not that interesting.
[fail] Poor thing, it must have been confused.

s4m1:
I was feeling ambitious today, like I could tackle anything.
While walking downtown, I saw a poster advertising a marathon.
?What do you think I thought?
[fail] I’d never do that—it’s too much work.
[success] Maybe I should try that—it’d be a challenge!
[fail] Oh no, running is the worst.

s4m2:
I was in a curious mood, eager to learn new things.
At the library,
I overheard someone discussing an unusual hobby—building miniature ships in bottles.
?What would you say about that?
[fail] Sounds boring, honestly.
[fail] It’s impressive, but I’d never try it.
[success] That’s fascinating! I’d love to see how it’s done.

s4m3:
I felt a bit philosophical today, pondering how little choices shape big outcomes.
I had to choose between two routes home—
one through the busy market and one through a quiet alley.
?Which do you think I chose?
[success] The quiet alley—it gives you space to think.
[fail] The busy market—it’s lively and fun.
[fail] Neither—you probably took a cab.

s4m4:
I was in an optimistic mood, expecting good things to happen.
While shopping, I found a long line at the checkout but decided to wait anyway.
?Why do you think I stayed?
[fail] You wanted to practice patience.
[success] You thought something good might come of it.
[fail] You didn’t care—you had time to spare.

s5m1:
I was feeling imaginative, letting my mind wander wherever it wanted.
While lying in the grass, I stared at the clouds and started to see shapes in them.
?What do you think I imagined?
[success] A dragon flying through the sky.
[fail] A bird landing in a tree.
[fail] Nothing—you probably fell asleep.

s5m2:
I felt peaceful, enjoying the stillness of the moment.
The clouds drifted by, and I thought about how fleeting things can be.
?What might I have said about them?
[fail] Those clouds look like cotton candy—fun but fleeting.
[success] Life’s like these clouds—beautiful and always moving on.
[fail] Clouds are just clouds—no point in thinking too much.

s5m3:
I was in a playful mood, wanting to find humor in everything.
One cloud in particular caught my eye, and it made me laugh.
?What do you think it looked like?
[fail] A wyvern balancing on a ball.
[fail] A jester juggling bananas.
[success] A dog with a goofy expression.

s5m4:
I was feeling nostalgic, thinking about the past.
Watching the clouds reminded me of when I was a child,
lying in the grass and dreaming big dreams.
?What would I have thought about?
[fail] I wish I had more time to relax now.
[success] I wonder if my younger self would be proud of me.
[fail] I should go back to my childhood home.

s6m1:
I was feeling empathetic, putting myself in others’ shoes.
Passing by a road worker under the hot sun,
I couldn’t help but think about their day.
?What did I think?
[success] They’re working hard—what keeps them motivated?
[fail] They must hate this job.
[fail] That looks tough, but at least they’re getting gold.

s6m2:
I was feeling grateful, appreciating the little things in life.
I saw a road worker fixing a pothole,
and it made me reflect on how much I take smooth roads for granted.
?What might I have thought?
[fail] They should work faster—I’m in a hurry.
[success] I’m glad someone’s doing this job.
[fail] I bet they don’t even notice.

s6m3:
I was feeling impatient, frustrated by delays.
The road worker was holding up traffic, and I couldn’t get where I needed to be.
?What do you think I thought in that moment?
[fail] I should yell at them to hurry up.
[fail] Maybe I’ll just turn around and find another way.
[success] They’re doing an important job.

s6m4:
I was feeling curious,
wondering what it’s like to do something so different from my own work.
The road worker seemed focused, carefully filling a pothole.
?What might I have asked myself?
[fail] How long until they’re done?
[success] What would it feel like to work with your hands all day?
[fail] Why do they always work when it is busy?

s6m5:
!frustrated
I was frustrated, as though everything was against me today.
While cycling home, I had to push through a strong headwind that refused to let up.
?It made me wonder if there’s any point to fighting the wind sometimes.
[fail] Maybe you just need a better bike?
${GLOBAL/KNOWbike:[success] It's not about the wind; it's about persistence.:[^BIKE] Cycle?}
[fail] It’s probably just nature telling you to slow down.

BIKE:
~know/cycle.txt

s6m6:
!awkward
I was feeling awkward, like I didn’t quite fit in.
While walking down the street, some people started whistling at me out of nowhere.
?It left me wondering how I should have responded.
[success] You’re not obligated to respond.
[fail] You could have smiled and waved—it’s harmless.
[fail] Maybe next time you can whistle back to confuse them?

s6m7:
!thoughtful
I was in a thoughtful mood, reflecting on the little things in life.
At home, I spent a good five minutes fiddling with a ring of keys,
trying to find the right one to open my door.
?It made me think about how such small moments shape our day.
[fail] Why not mark your keys?
[fail] Maybe you just need fewer locks on your door.
[success] Challenges make the eventual success feel better.

s6m8:
!cheerful
I was in a cheerful mood, as if the world had decided to smile back at me for once.
While out, I found a perfectly round stone that seemed almost too smooth to be real.
?It made me think about how nature creates such simple beauty.
[success] Maybe it’s a reminder to appreciate the little things around us.
[fail] You should check if it’s a lucky charm or something.
[fail] Probably just years of water and erosion doing their thing.

s6m9:
!annoyed
I was annoyed, as though people had no concept of boundaries.
While walking down the street, someone whistled at me again,
but this time it felt intentionally mocking.
?It left me wondering why people do such things.
[fail] Maybe they thought it was funny—it’s just a joke, right?
[success] People often mock others to feel better about themselves.
[fail] You should’ve ignored it and walked away.

s6m10:
!conflicted
I felt conflicted, torn between my own needs and someone else’s.
A close friend approached me, asking for a loan they swore they’d pay back soon.
?It made me question if helping them was the right choice.
[fail] You should never lend money; it ruins friendships.
[success] Trust them but set clear expectations.
[fail] You could’ve just said no—it’s safer that way.

s6m11:
!empathetic
I felt empathetic, imagining myself in someone else’s shoes.
While walking through town, a stranger approached me,
begging for money with a desperate look in their eyes.
?It made me wonder what I’d do if I were in their place.
[success] Offering even a little could mean a lot to them.
[fail] Tough love is helpful.
[fail] It’s a scam; ignore it.

s6m12:
!scientific
I was in a scientific mood, curious about how the world works in intricate detail.
I noticed a puddle of water rippling in a strange,
rhythmic pattern, as if it was alive.
?It got me thinking about what could cause such an unusual sight.
[success] Probably vibrations from something nearby.
[fail] Maybe the wind just made it behave oddly.
[fail] Could it be some sort of tiny creature disturbing the surface?

s6m13:
!analytical
I was analytical, looking for patterns in the chaos of the day.
At the café, I watched steam rise from my coffee, swirling into fascinating shapes.
?It made me ponder why the patterns always seemed random but beautiful.
[success] It’s likely a result of the heat.
[fail] Maybe it’s just luck—random things are sometimes pretty.
[fail] Could it be the shape of the cup influencing the steam?

fail: 
I guess so...

success: 
Yes... I'm glad we get along so well.
