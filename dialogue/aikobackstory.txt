Oh, hello there. ${knowsname:Good to see you again.:My name is Aiko.}

?Is there something you'd like to talk about?
[label1] Tell me about your past.
[label2] What’s your secret?
[label3] Just curious.
[talk] Let's talk.

label1:
!neutral
Ah, it’s not much of a story.
?I grew up on the streets, learned how to fend for myself.
[label4] You must have learned a lot from that.
[label5] Did you have anyone to rely on?

label2:
!neutral
A secret? Ha, I wouldn’t call it that. 
?When you’ve lived like I have, you pick up some skills. 
[label6] What kind of skills? Are you tough?
[label3] Never mind, I was just curious.

label3:
!neutral
Suit yourself. But don’t expect me to trust you if you’re not willing to talk either.

label4:
!neutral
Yeah, I guess you could say I learned a lot. Mostly the hard way, though.
It’s why I don’t like people getting too close.

label5:
!neutral
?Not really. People on the streets aren’t exactly looking out for you, you know?
[label6] Must have made you tough.
[label10] That sounds really lonely.

label6:
!neutral
You could say that. I don’t like to brag, but I can handle myself in a fight.
I don't really like to be touched, though.

label10:
!neutral
Lonely? Maybe. But that’s just how life is sometimes.
