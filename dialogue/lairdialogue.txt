Chapter One: Making Friends is Like Baking Bread.
%loaf.jpg
Warmth, patience, and the right ingredients are essential.
But remember—some people will rise to the occasion, and others will flop.
Don’t take it personally.
!neutral
Step one: Smile! A genuine smile is the key to making someone feel at ease.
Not a grimace, not a smirk—practice in a mirror if necessary.
Bonus points if it doesn’t look like you’re plotting world domination.
!excited
Step two: Show interest!
Ask questions like, ‘What do you enjoy?’ or ‘What’s your greatest fear?’
(Okay, maybe save that second one for later.)
!cheerful
Chapter Two: Navigating Awkward Conversations.
%awkward.jpg
Awkward silences are inevitable, but fear not!
Simply comment on something neutral, like the weather, the decor, 
or how amazing your outfit is today. If all else fails, a compliment never hurts.
!soft
Pro Tip: Listening is your secret weapon. People love to talk about themselves.
Nodding and the occasional ‘Oh, really?’ work wonders to keep the conversation going.
Just don’t nod too much, or you’ll look like a bobblehead.
!neutral
Chapter Three: Handling Conflict With Grace. Conflict happens, even between friends.
If someone’s upset, apologize—without adding ‘but.’
For example, say, ‘I’m sorry I forgot your birthday,’ not,
‘I’m sorry, but I had to overthrow a kingdom that day.’
!cheerful
Exercise: Practice saying, ‘You might be right,’
in a way that doesn’t sound sarcastic.

It’ll take a while, but trust me—it’s worth it.

Conclusion: Friendship is a delicate balance of kindness,
understanding, and occasional bribery.
Always carry snacks—

you’d be amazed at what a well-timed cookie can do for a strained relationship.

Thank you for reading *Mastering the Art of Friendship*!
Go forth, charm the masses, and remember: even the greatest leaders needed allies.
And cookies.

The first step to being ruthless without losing friends is to define your goals.

Clarity is key!

Chapter Two: Charisma and Control. Ruthless doesn’t mean friendless.
In fact, charm is your best weapon.
%handshake.jpg
Smile like you mean it—even when you’re planning someone’s downfall.
A heartfelt 'thank you' after a betrayal works wonders.
!cheerful
%mirror.jpg
Exercise: Practice saying, 'I’m sorry you feel that way,' in front of a mirror.
It’s the perfect non-apology for when your actions cause someone distress!

Chapter Three: Boundaries are Everything.
Being ruthless doesn’t mean doing everything yourself.
Delegate! It’s not exploitation—it’s leadership. But beware of rebellion.
A well-fed and slightly fearful ally is a loyal ally.
!cheerful
%bribe.jpg
Pro Tip: Bribery is underrated. A little gift can soften even the sharpest betrayal.
Don’t be stingy!
!smile
%victory.jpg
Conclusion: Ruthlessness is a balance of ambition and connection.
Remember, you can be the most feared ruler—or CEO—
but you’ll need people to toast your success at the end of the day.
So, keep your allies close, your enemies closer, and your wit sharp!
