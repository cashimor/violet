The Temple welcomes you into its embrace, Violet.
Let the silence guide your thoughts and the darkness sharpen your will.

The Temple holds many secrets... 
#>itsukiVisit
#Some of your members are complaining about strange thefts lately.
#There's a rumor about a vigilante stealing from the rich.
#Someone mentioned a new gang in town. Might be unrelated, but worth looking into.
#People say the Goddess has been unusually quiet. Have you noticed anything?
#I foresee that the Xivato will come and capture more territory.
#Nothing unusual to report.
#I saw a shadow moving where no one stood—must be my imagination.
#The Xivato seem restless; they might be planning something soon.
#There are whispers of a rival faction trying to undermine us.

itsukiVisit:
We have a very devoted follower named Itsuki visiting the temple often.
Quite an argumentative fellow. Claims we got the name of the Goddess wrong.
Still is quite devout, though. Prays deep and often. Lots of strength.
