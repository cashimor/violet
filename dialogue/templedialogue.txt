Oh, chosen one, seeker of power. 
?What brings you to the sacred Temple of Malvani?
[meditate] I seek clarity and strength.

[chat] I want to talk.

meditate:
The Temple welcomes you into its embrace, Violet.
Let the silence guide your thoughts and the darkness sharpen your will.
Do you feel renewed?

The divine power flows through you now, Violet.
Malvani's shadow watches over your every move.
May it shield you from your enemies and amplify your ambitions.

The Temple holds many secrets... 
But I am here to listen. What weighs on your mind?
