start:
You were at the police station? You really shouldn't interfere with them.
?They are doing their best.
[police_bribe] They like money
[police_theft] I reported a theft
[police_chat] I just chatted

police_bribe:
They do, but you shouldn't encourage it.

police_theft:
?Is someone stealing from you?
[police_itsuki] Itsuki
[police_yes] Yes
[nothing] It's handled

police_yes:
Well, hopefully they can solve the case.

police_itsuki:
@setTidbit(itsuki)

itsuki:
So you got to this world because this Itsuki prayed for you,
and then you repayed this by putting him in jail?
I know that he is stealing from you, but there must be a better way, no?
?You should see if you can bail him out.
