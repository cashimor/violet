${knowsname:Violet! Good to see you again!:I'm Ume.}
@setTidbit(knowsname)

knowsname:
?Welcome! Oh, um, do you need help with something?
[ask] Tell me about yourself.
[compliment] You seem really skilled.
[talk] Let's talk.

ask:
Well, there’s not much to tell. I’m just Ume... I work as a lab assistant, and,
?um, sometimes people say I’m good at chemistry and stuff.
[tease] That’s modest. You seem amazing!
[chemistry] How did you get so good at chemistry?
[physical] You look strong too. Do you train?

chemistry:
!happy
Oh, chemistry? I’ve always liked figuring out how things work,
but I guess I started really studying hard because...
well, people used to make fun of me.
I didn’t want to give them a reason, so I thought,
?‘I’ll be so good at something they’ll have to respect me!’
[continue] That’s impressive!
[makefun] Make fun of you?
[joke] Did it work?

makefun:
Yes... I do look a bit different. They used to call me names.
But I accept them now. You can call me the plump plum too, if you want.
But it made me stronger in all areas. Except loaning money.
I still worry people will pick on me.

physical:
!neutral
Ah, you noticed? Yeah, I practice judo. Same reason, really.
If you’re strong, people don’t bother you as much.
?But I like it too—it’s nice to feel capable, you know?
[judo] So you can throw someone twice your size?
[continue] You’ve worked hard to get here, huh?

judo:
!happy
Definitely! It’s all about leverage and timing.
?Not that many twice my size anyway. Careful, or I might have to show you!
[laugh] I’ll keep that in mind!
[serious] You’ve really earned your strength.

tease:
!neutral
Oh, you’re just saying that... but, um, thank you. I’ve tried hard, I guess.
?Would you like to ask more?
[chemistry] How did you get so good at chemistry?
[physical] You look strong too. Do you train?
[end] I’ll let you get back to your work.

end:

laugh:
!shock
Good, because I don’t think you’d be easy to pin down anyway.

serious:
!neutral
Thank you. That means a lot. I don’t always feel like I’m strong enough, but I try.

talk:
~talkdialogue.txt

compliment:
!shock
Thank you... It wasn’t easy, but I didn’t want to let their words define me.
!neutral
I guess I just wanted to prove that I could be more.
Although I am still bad at asking for people to return things that I lend them.
I just worry it will become like it was in the past.
