Oh, Violet. You’ve made it this far. I’m so glad we can finally speak again.
?Though, I must admit, I thought you’d arrive a little taller.
[question1] Why did you bring me here?
[question2] What do you want from me?
[question3] I’m not sure I trust you
[joke1] I grew in other ways

joke1:
So you have. But maybe just an inch?
>question1

question1:
I brought you here because this world needed you.
It needed someone with the strength to challenge its broken systems
and bring about change.
?And, well, I may have spun the wheel of fate a little recklessly to find you.
[continue1] And you think I’m that person?
[resist1] You stole me from my life for that?

question2:
I want what is best for this world, Violet.
And I believe you can help shape a future where compassion and justice reign.
Or, you know, just help me figure out why birds don’t pray anymore.
?It’s baffling, really.
[continue2] That sounds... naive
[resist2] And what if I don’t care about justice?
[joke2] Did they ever?

joke2:
I think so. I recall being quite a-twitter.

>question3

question3:
I understand your hesitation.
You’ve been through so much, and trust is not easily given.
But my intentions are pure, Violet. 
?And by pure, I mean mostly free of celestial paperwork.
[continue3] Then prove it to me.
[resist3] Words are cheap. Actions matter.

continue1:
Yes, Violet. You’ve shown resilience, intelligence, and determination.
These are the qualities this world desperately needs.
?${GLOBAL/KNOWfood:Plus, you survived eating that dubious udon.: } Truly inspiring.
[end1] I’ll consider what you’ve said.
[end2] I don’t think I’m the hero you’re looking for.

continue2:
Naive, perhaps. But isn’t hope worth pursuing?
Even amidst the darkness, a single light can guide the way.
Also, do you think lightbulbs count as divine miracles?
?I’ve been debating this with myself.
[end3] I’ll think about it
[end4] I’m not interested in being your light
[joke3] Lightbulbs are amazing

joke3:
Yes... I think only you can appreciate the magic behind lights that just turn on.
>continue3

continue3:
Very well. I will grant you the means to see my vision for this world.
Use it wisely, Violet.
?And if you find any stray birds, please tell them I miss their songs.
[end5] What do you mean by that?
[end6] I’ll see for myself.

resist1:
Perhaps I acted selfishly. But I believed in your potential, Violet.
You’ve already done so much. 
?Also, I may have misplaced the instruction manual for cosmic interventions.
[end7] I need time to think about this.
[end8] You had no right to make that choice for me.

resist2:
Then I cannot force you. But remember, Violet, 
even the most hardened hearts can find purpose in helping others.
?Also, you don’t have to help birds, but just keep them in mind, okay?
[end9] Maybe you’re right.
[end10] That’s not who I am.

resist3:
Then let my actions speak.
I will aid you in your journey, no matter what path you choose.
Even if that path involves explaining this world’s fascination with...
?karaoke machines.
[end11] I’ll hold you to that.
[end12] We’ll see.
[^KARAOKE] Karaoke machines?

KARAOKE:

end1:
Take your time, Violet. I’ll be here if you need guidance.
And maybe some tea. Do mortals still enjoy tea?

end2:
Perhaps not. But even if you doubt yourself, I still believe in you. And tea.
Definitely tea.

end3:
That’s all I ask. Thank you, Violet.
I’ll try to keep my celestial interventions to a minimum.

end4:
I understand. But know that I’ll always be here, should you change your mind.
Or need someone to discuss bird migration patterns with.

end5:
In time, you will see what I mean. Until then, go forth with my blessing.
And don’t forget to look up sometimes—it’s where all the interesting stuff happens.

end6:
Then I trust your judgment, Violet. May your path lead to wisdom and understanding.
And maybe a little bit of celestial humor.

end7:
Of course. I only hope that, in time, you’ll see why I chose you.
And maybe forgive my slightly overzealous meddling.

end8:
You’re right. Perhaps I overstepped. But even so, I cannot undo what has been done.
Not without significant celestial paperwork, at least.

end9:
Then let that thought guide you. I’ll always be here to support you, Violet.
And occasionally debate the merits of tea versus coffee.

end10:
Perhaps not. But I still have faith in you, Violet.
Even if you don’t share my bird-related enthusiasm.

end11:
I wouldn’t expect anything less. Thank you, Violet.
Now, onward to your destiny—or the nearest karaoke bar.

end12:
Indeed, we shall. Farewell for now, Violet. And please, do try the tea. It’s divine.
