community:
I stopped stealing from your loan shark offices. But I still don't like them.
?Don't you think we should give back to the community?
[give] Donate to charity?
[how] What's your idea?
[no] It's all ours.

no:
Of course Violet...

give:
That would be an option, certainly.

how:
?Well... you could sell your businesses and make them legitimate.
[alright] Let's start on that.
[no] It's all ours.

alright:
Fantastic. I'm so glad you listen to me.

${We should do something fun.|>come}
?I think it is time to use that Karaoke machine, don't you think?
[yes] Of course
[no] I can't sing

come:
Please come to your lair for a change, Violet. I want to do something in person.

no:
We can do it next time... after you practice more.

yes:
So the song is "Beyond Belief - Chapter II".
No... I don't have chapter one. I'm not sure there is one.
You're going first, but don't worry about the first bit. Just say the words.
It will be fine.

ðŸŽµ I. I don't understand. I was everything you asked for. ðŸŽµ (#8)
ðŸŽµ All you could not leave in the hands of fate. Because I am that girl. ðŸŽµ (#6)
ðŸŽµ The girl you prayed for. For whom your prayers will go unanswered. ðŸŽµ (#5)
ðŸŽµ Am I not the better god? (Am I not the demoness of your dreams?) ðŸŽµ (#6)

ðŸŽµ Never. Never. Never. Never doubt believing that it can happen. ðŸŽµ (#8)
ðŸŽµ It goes beyond human belief because I saw her. She walked toward me. ðŸŽµ (#6)
ðŸŽµ I was even unworthy to see her. Doubt was unsure. Am I unworthy for you? ðŸŽµ (#8)
!violet
ðŸŽµ O mother snake. She who glows with divine light. She that you couldn't lose. ðŸŽµ (#10)
ðŸŽµ Then why should you win me? If it happened. Before your eyes. It hesitated. ðŸŽµ (#8)
ðŸŽµ In the silencing sunset. Whose gold surpassed all doubt. ðŸŽµ (#5)
ðŸŽµ Am I not allowed to waver? ðŸŽµ (#14)

It's just a song, Violet... it doesn't mean that I prefer Nirvani over you...

pivotal:
Do you ever think about her? The Goddess, I mean.
About what she wantedâ€”what I wantedâ€”when I prayed for you?
Sometimes I wonder if I made a mistake... if my prayer wasnâ€™t about her at all.
Maybe it was about me. What I wanted. What I couldnâ€™t handle on my own.
And now, here you are. I believed in you so fiercely.
?But... are you what I believed in? Or are you just someone I forced into being?
[status_quo] Iâ€™m here because Iâ€™m strong enough to survive
[curiosity] What made you so sure I was the one?
[vulnerability] What do you see when you look at me now?

status_quo:
Youâ€™re right. Maybe I am flattering myself.

curiosity:
I believed in your strength. Your courage.
I saw someone who could change everythingâ€”who could stand up to fate itself.
And at first... maybe thatâ€™s all you were. An idea.
But now... youâ€™re real. Flawed and angry and human in ways I didnâ€™t expect.
?And I donâ€™t know if that makes you more or less of what I prayed for.
[press_further] Am I still that idea to you?
[deflect] Maybe Iâ€™m just good at pretending
[status_quo] I am perfect

press_further:
Youâ€™re not just an idea anymore. Youâ€™re more than that.
But... I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ready to say what that means yet.
>merge

deflect:
Maybe weâ€™re all just pretending a little, Violet.
But I donâ€™t think youâ€™re as false as you want me to believe.
>merge

vulnerability:
When I look at you now, I see... everything I canâ€™t understand.
Someone who terrifies me and amazes me all at once.
Youâ€™re stronger than I could ever be, but...
thereâ€™s something about you that feels so alone.
?Maybe I donâ€™t just believe in you. Maybe... I feel responsible for you, too.
[defensive] Youâ€™ve done enough already
[open_up] And what if I am alone?
[humor] Youâ€™re starting to sound like a bad romance novel
[status_quo] You're just my tool

defensive:
Maybe youâ€™re not. But that doesnâ€™t mean I can just stop caring.
>merge

open_up:
Then Iâ€™d stay. If youâ€™d let me.
>merge

humor:
Well, Iâ€™ve read worse. But I mean it, Violet. Iâ€™m here for a reason.
>merge

merge:
You donâ€™t owe me anything, Violet. I prayed because I believed in you.
?And I still do. But if you want to try... I wonâ€™t stop you.
[oath] Admit blood debt
[hug] Hug

oath:
I see... I'm not sure about your customs, but I shall accept this.
@setTidbit(blooddebt)

hug:
Oh... awkward...
