🎵 I. I don't understand. I was everything you asked for. 🎵 (#8)
🎵 All you could not leave in the hands of fate. Because I am that girl. 🎵 (#6)
🎵 The girl you prayed for. For whom your prayers will go unanswered. 🎵 (#5)
🎵 Am I not the better god? (Am I not the demoness of your dreams?) 🎵 (#6)

🎵 Never. Never. Never. Never doubt believing that it can happen. 🎵 (#8)
🎵 It goes beyond human belief because I saw her. She walked toward me. 🎵 (#6)
🎵 I was even unworthy to see her. Doubt was unsure. Am I unworthy for you? 🎵 (#8)

🎵 O mother snake. She who glows with divine light. She that you couldn't lose. 🎵 (#10)
🎵 Then why should you win me? If it happened. Before your eyes. It hesitated. 🎵 (#8)
🎵 In the silencing sunset. Whose gold surpassed all doubt. 🎵 (#5)
🎵 Am I not allowed to waver? 🎵 (#14)
