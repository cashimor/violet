Yes, it’s a 'magical' device that lets you talk to people far away, send messages,
and even learn things from a vast network called the world wide web.  
Not that kind of web.
Think of it as a library where you can find almost anything—if you know how to look.  
You tap the screen to open your contacts and select who to call. Easy, right?  
Trust me, you’ll get the hang of it. Oh, and it can even take pictures!
You can keep them or share them with others. A truly remarkable tool for modern life.
Even young children know how to use them, even if they perhaps shouldn't.
