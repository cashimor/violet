It's a particular form of entertainment. There's a machine, the karaoke machine,
which allows selecting a song. The lyrics of the song are shown on a screen.
The participants sing a song, one by one. It rarely goes according to plan.
There are karaoke bars where you can do this. Make sure you bring friends.
Friends you can trust. And me. I'd love to come with you.
