You don't know what a traffic light is? How did you survive?
They are lights that indicate it is safe to go in a particular direction.
Usually red means stop, yellow means be wary, and green means go.
Sometimes there is white, in case you can go, but it may still not be safe.
?How did you cross streets if you didn't know this?
[normal] I prayed.
[thank] Thank you.
[normal] I raised my hand.
[magic] I pretended to cast a spell.

thank:
You're welcome... be safe...

normal:
I guess you can do that. But really, just don't go when it is red.

magic:
Magic? You know that doesn't exist here, right?
