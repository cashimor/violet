?What ${brings you here|made you call}?
[label1] Tell me about your past.
[label2] What’s your secret?
[label3] Just ${passing through|checking}.

?My past? Not much to it, honestly. 
Grew up in luxury, got bored of it.
?Bars were way more interesting.
[label4] Bars?
[label5] You had it easy.

label2:
!neutral
?Secret? Ha! If you can read people, the game is yours.
That’s why I’m so good at what I do.. Watching. Controlling.

label3:
!neutral
Alright, well, let me know if you need something.

label4:
!neutral
Oh, definitely. I love looking at people. 
You get to know who’s bluffing, who’s serious, and who you shouldn’t mess with.
It’s like a sport, really.

label5:
!neutral
Easy? Maybe. But money doesn’t teach you how to live.
That’s why I’m terrible at managing it.
