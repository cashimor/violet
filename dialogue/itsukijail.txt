start:
!neutral
You.
I was wondering when you’d show up.
!smirk
?You’ve got a lot of nerve, Violet. Reporting me? After everything?
[justify] You forced my hand
[defensive] You were stealing from me!
[remorseful] I shouldn’t have done it
[taunt] This is where you belong

justify:
!angry
What’s yours?!
How much do people need to suffer for you to feel like you’ve won, Violet?
Is it never enough?
!neutral
I thought you might be different. Once. Clearly, I was wrong.
!neutral
Go on, then. Enjoy your 'victory.'
But remember, this cell might keep me in—for now—but you’re trapped too.
You just don’t see it yet.

defensive:
!serious
I expected better, Violet. But maybe that’s on me.
!neutral
You’ve built this empire of yours, but at what cost?
How many people’s lives did you trample to stand where you are now?
!neutral
Stealing from your loan sharks wasn’t about me.
It was about stopping the harm you’re doing.
But I guess that’s too much for you to understand.
I won’t be here forever, Violet. And when I’m out, I’ll keep fighting.
Someone has to.

remorseful:
!neutral
Then why did you, Violet? Was it pride? Fear?
Or have you just become the kind of person who betrays people
without a second thought?
I don’t know if I can forgive you for this. Not yet.
But… maybe there’s still hope for you. Maybe.
I don’t know what you’re looking for, Violet.
But whatever it is, you won’t find it like this.
But thank you for bailing me out again.

taunt:
It is, is it? Hopefully you will go where you belong as well.
