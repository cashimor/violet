You seem lost. Tell me, what brings you to me?
?What would you like to ask?
[path_to_redemption] How do I find peace here?
[past_experiences] Who are you?
[talk] Let's talk.

path_to_redemption:
!thoughtful
Peace? It is not something you find—it is something you nurture.
I can guide you to stillness, but your choices will determine your path.
!neutral
Many who seek peace have first walked through fire. I see the same in you.
#But every path has its pitfalls.
#Strength is not always the answer, though it often seems the easiest one.
If you ever need counsel, return to me.
I may not have answers, but I can offer perspective.

past_experiences:
!serious
I am Takeshi. My life has been one of learning—and, I fear, of failure.
!distant
I once trained as a soldier. But I turned away from that path.
?Why do you ask?
[advice] I’m curious—what do you think of power?
[personal] Tell me more about your past.

advice:
!guiding
Power is a blade with two edges.
If wielded without care, it will harm the one who holds it.
I could not see that in my youth, and I paid dearly for it.
!thoughtful
Yet... perhaps power can heal, if used wisely.
I hope your path brings you to that understanding.

personal:
!distant
I am not sure why you want to know, but I will tell you this much.
!serious
I failed those who depended on me. I sought strength but found only pride.
When I realized my error, it was too late.
!neutral
These days, I find peace in small things. Guiding others, meditating.
There is little else I am suited for.
#A commander? No, my hesitation would doom an army.
#A businessman? I would crumble under the weight of ambition.
#But perhaps as a priest... if the temple values sincerity over power.
?What about you?
[shared_purpose] Do you believe people can change?
[return_to_start] I should go.

shared_purpose:
!curious
Change is not easy. It takes more than will—it takes guidance, time, and grace.
!guiding
Perhaps that is why our paths have crossed.
If you seek to change, I will walk with you for as long as you need.

return_to_start:
!neutral
Very well. You are welcome here anytime.
