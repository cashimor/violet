You know, Violet, I’ve known about you for a long time.
!curious
?I mean, not *you* exactly, but your story. It’s strange... almost unbelievable.
[curious] What do you mean, my story?
[uninterested] I don’t care about your delusions.

curious:
!thoughtful
There’s this manga I’ve had since I was a kid.
It tells the story of boy who becomes emperor through scheming.
?You are one of the villains in the story.
[disbelief] That’s ridiculous. It’s just a coincidence.
[interest] Show me this manga.

uninterested:
!neutral
Oh... right. You wouldn’t care. Forget I said anything.

disbelief:
!defensive
?I know it would sounds crazy to you! But it is why I prayed for you.
[interest] Show me this manga.
[walkaway] You’re wasting my time.
[villain] You prayed for the villain?

interest:
!excited
Hold on! I’ll get it!
!thoughtful
?Here. Look at this.
[read] Read it to me.
[skeptical] You’re reaching. It’s just a story.

skeptical:
!neutral
Maybe. But if you ever want to see it again, let me know. I’ll keep it safe.

walkaway:
!sad
Alright. Sorry for bothering you.

villain:
You seemed beautiful to me. And wronged. I was hoping...
you'd realize your potential, and become better. Or at least, be with me.
