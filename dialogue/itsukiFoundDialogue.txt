Back again?
>question

rant:
!neutral
I didn’t think I’d see you again. Not after what happened.
!angry
Did you forget? Or maybe you thought I did.
All the money I saved, gone. And you just... disappeared.
!neutral
But here you are.

question:
?Violet... why are you here?
[apology] Make amends.
[know] How do you know me?
[family] Family
${priestitsuki:[temple] You were at the temple:[deflect] I need something.}
${loanitsuki:[stop] Stop stealing my money: }

stop:
You know I am not going to stop Violet.
Loan sharking is an evil that prays on the weak.
I know how you are with money, but it isn't acceptable.
?The only thing that you can do is make it into a legitimate credit union.
[never] Never!
[how] How do I do that?
[talk] We'll talk later.

never:
Of course you won't.

how:
Oh... it's fairly easy. Just talk to the people in your loan "office".
They will gladly do it.
@setTidbit(GLOBAL/communitypossible)

talk:
Alright. But consider my offer.

know:
~itsukimanga.txt

temple:
Yes... that was one of the few nice things that you did.
?Build a temple for the Goddess. Although...
[back] I would like you in my life
[talk] We'll talk later.
${goddessrealname:[although2]:[although]} Although what?

although2:
You should go to the temple more. Pray.

although:
?You know Malvani isn't her name, right?
[now] It is now
[realname] What is her name?
[talk] We'll talk later
[yes] I know

now:
I see... I guess it is.

yes:
!sad
You knew her name was Nirvani, but you decided Malvani was better.
!neutral
You are cruel, in a way.
Although the Goddess seems pleased with the attention nonetheless.

realname:
@setTidbit(goddessrealname)

goddessrealname:
She's called Nirvani. Maybe not the best name. But the name in which she saved you.
That should count for something.

back:
You want to...
!shock
Oh... you want me to join you. Is that even possible?
Is there still a place in your life for me?
@selectJob(Evil Lair)

selectJobFail:
You have no place for me in your life anymore Violet.
Someone else lives in your lair.

apology:
!thoughtful
Mistakes? You think that’s enough to undo the damage you caused?
!sad
I... prayed for you, Violet. Believed in you.
I thought we’d make the world better together.
!neutral
?But now? I’m not sure I believe anything anymore.
[reason] I never asked for your faith.
[help] I still want to make things right.

reason:
!angry
No, you didn’t. But that doesn’t make what you did any less cruel.
You used me. And now? You want... what, forgiveness?
!neutral
You’re going to have to do more than just show up, Violet.
>decision

help:
!surprised
You do? After everything?
!neutral
I don’t know if I can trust you again. But maybe... maybe you can prove me wrong.
>decision

decision:
?What can I do to prove it?
[offer_help] You need help?
[walk_away] I don’t need your trust.

offer_help:
${partneritsuki:>genuineoffer:!neutral}
I'm sorry. You don't seem sincere.
I'm not sure there is anything you can do at this time.

genuineoffer:
Something has changed inside you Violet. I believe in you again.
Hopefully you can stay this way.
${offeredHelp:I remember.:@adjustEvilness(-10)}

goodviolet:
setTidbit(offeredHelp)

walk_away:
!angry
So that’s it? You haven’t changed at all.
You’ll keep running, Violet.
But one day, you won’t be able to escape what you’ve done.

deflect:
You always need things Violet.
You should think what others need from you for a change.

family:
${Nys/dumb:>nys:Yes, I have family. I visit them sometimes.}
I can introduce you, if you want.

nys:
!serious
Yes...
I prayed for your sister Nys to come here after you went off and never talked to me.
?There’s something I should explain about your sister’s arrival.
[prayer1] Go on, Itsuki
[prayer2] Another one of your prayers
[prayer3] Are you blaming me?

prayer1:
!neutral
I… I prayed for her to come.
After you mentioned your family,
?I thought perhaps having someone familiar might help you… reconnect.
[reason1] You thought Nys would help *me*?
[reason2] Do you realize who my sister is?
[reason3] And you didn’t think to ask me first?

prayer2:
!neutral
Actually, it is.
After everything you’ve been through,
?I thought having someone who loves you unconditionally could… soften the edges.
[reason4] Unconditionally? You have no idea
[reason5] That’s a bold assumption
[reason6] Soft edges?

prayer3:
!defensive
No, no! I just thought… Look, I’ve seen how much you’ve carried alone.
?I thought your sister might share some of that weight.
[reason7] You thought wrong
[reason8] Weight? She's quite heavy
[reason9] Why didn’t you come to me with this first?

reason1:
!smile
I… may have underestimated the complexity of your relationship.
?But she does care for you deeply, doesn’t she?
[reaction1] She's never deep
[reaction2] Caring isn’t the same as being helpful

reason2:
!neutral
I only knew what you’ve told me.
?And it seemed like there was still a bond, despite everything.
[reaction3] A bond, yes. But not the kind you want here
[reaction4] You’re too optimistic

reason3:
!apologetic
I… didn’t think it was something you’d agree to.
?But I believed it was the right thing to do.
[reaction5] Wrong
[reaction6] You’re lucky I’m not furious

reason4:
!thoughtful
?Maybe not, but she’s still your family. That has to mean something, right?
[reaction7] Family doesn’t fix everything
[reaction8] It means more complications

reason5:
!neutral
?Maybe. But I’ve seen you push everyone away. I thought she might be an exception.
[reaction9] She’s the rule
[reaction10] Good intentions

reason6:
!apologetic
That… came out wrong.
?I just meant, someone who isn’t tied to the darkness you’ve faced might be a light.
[reaction11] A dim light, maybe
[reaction12] Light she is

reason7:
!defensive
I… thought it was worth the risk. She’s your sister, Violet.
?And you deserve someone who’s on your side.
[reaction13] Your side, yes
[reaction14] Good luck

reason8:
!neutral
?Maybe. But she’s still someone who loves you. Isn’t that worth something?
[reaction15] She loves everyone
[reaction16] More headache

reason9:
!apologetic
?I should have. I’m sorry, Violet. I'll keep her with me.
[reaction17] Good
[reaction14] Apology accepted

reaction1:
!neutral
See? Maybe she can surprise you.

reaction2:
!neutral
Maybe not. But she’s here now. We’ll figure it out together.

reaction3:
!neutral
Fair enough. I won’t assume things again.

reaction4:
!smile
I’ve been accused of that before. But I still think it was worth trying.

reaction5:
!neutral
Maybe I did. I’ll leave it to you to decide how to handle her.

reaction6:
!smile
That’s… more than I expected. Thank you, Violet.

reaction7:
!neutral
No, it doesn’t. But maybe it’s a start.

reaction8:
!neutral
Complications, yes. But maybe good ones?

reaction9:
!neutral
I see that now. I’ll stay out of it.

reaction10:
!smile
Thank you. That means a lot.

reaction11:
!neutral
Dim is better than none, isn’t it?

reaction12:
!smile
I’m glad you do.

reaction13:
!neutral
Maybe she’ll surprise you. Or maybe not. It’s your call.

reaction14:
!smile
Thank you, Violet.

reaction15:
!neutral
That sounds… about right.

reaction16:
!smile
Headaches, maybe. But hopefully not for long.

reaction17:
!serious
Understood.
