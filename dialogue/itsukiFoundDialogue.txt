Back again?
>question

rant:
!neutral
I didn’t think I’d see you again. Not after what happened.
!angry
Did you forget? Or maybe you thought I did.
All the money I saved, gone. And you just... disappeared.
!neutral
But here you are.

question:
?Violet... why are you here?
[apology] Make amends.
[know] How do you know me?
${priestitsuki:[temple] You were at the temple:[deflect] I need something.}
${loanitsuki:[stop] Stop stealing my money: }

stop:
You know I am not going to stop Violet.
Loan sharking is an evil that prays on the weak.
I know how you are with money, but it isn't acceptable.
?The only thing that you can do is make it into a legitimate credit union.
[never] Never!
[how] How do I do that?
[talk] We'll talk later.

never:
Of course you won't.

how:
Oh... it's fairly easy. Just talk to the people in your loan "office".
They will gladly do it.
@setTidbit(GLOBAL/communitypossible)

talk:
Alright. But consider my offer.

know:
~itsukimanga.txt

temple:
Yes... that was one of the few nice things that you did.
?Build a temple for the Goddess. Although...
[back] I would like you in my life
[talk] We'll talk later.
${goddessrealname:[although2]:[although]} Although what?

although2:
You should go to the temple more. Pray.

although:
?You know Malvani isn't her name, right?
[now] It is now
[realname] What is her name?
[talk] We'll talk later
[yes] I know

now:
I see... I guess it is.

yes:
!sad
You knew her name was Nirvani, but you decided Malvani was better.
!neutral
You are cruel, in a way.
Although the Goddess seems pleased with the attention nonetheless.

realname:
@setTidbit(goddessrealname)

goddessrealname:
She's called Nirvani. Maybe not the best name. But the name in which she saved you.
That should count for something.

back:
You want to...
!shock
Oh... you want me to join you. Is that even possible?
Is there still a place in your life for me?
@selectJob(Evil Lair)

selectJobFail:
You have no place for me in your life anymore Violet.
Someone else lives in your lair.

apology:
!thoughtful
Mistakes? You think that’s enough to undo the damage you caused?
!sad
I... prayed for you, Violet. Believed in you.
I thought we’d make the world better together.
!neutral
?But now? I’m not sure I believe anything anymore.
[reason] I never asked for your faith.
[help] I still want to make things right.

reason:
!angry
No, you didn’t. But that doesn’t make what you did any less cruel.
You used me. And now? You want... what, forgiveness?
!neutral
You’re going to have to do more than just show up, Violet.
>decision

help:
!surprised
You do? After everything?
!neutral
I don’t know if I can trust you again. But maybe... maybe you can prove me wrong.
>decision

decision:
?What can I do to prove it?
[offer_help] You need help?
[walk_away] I don’t need your trust.

offer_help:
${partneritsuki:>genuineoffer:!neutral}
I'm sorry. You don't seem sincere.
I'm not sure there is anything you can do at this time.

genuineoffer:
Something has changed inside you Violet. I believe in you again.
Hopefully you can stay this way.
${offeredHelp:I remember.:@adjustEvilness(-10)}

walk_away:
!angry
So that’s it? You haven’t changed at all.
You’ll keep running, Violet.
But one day, you won’t be able to escape what you’ve done.

deflect:
You always need things Violet.
You should think what others need from you for a change.
