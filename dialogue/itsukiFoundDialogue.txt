Back again?

I didn’t think I’d see you again. Not after what happened.
!angry
Did you forget? Or maybe you thought I did.
All the money I saved, gone. And you just... disappeared.
!neutral
But here you are.

question:
?Violet... why are you here?
[apology] Make amends.
[know] How do you know me?
${priestitsuki:[back] I want to.:[deflect] I need something.}
${loanitsuki:[stop] Stop stealing my money.: }

stop:
You know I am not going to stop Violet.
Loan sharking is an evil that prays on the weak.
I know how you are with money, but it isn't acceptable.
?The only thing that you can do is make it into a legitimate credit union.
[never] Never!
[how] How do I do that?
[talk] We'll talk later.

never:
Of course you won't.

how:
Oh... it's fairly easy. Just talk to the people in your loan "office".
They will gladly do it.
@setTidbit(GLOBAL/communitypossible)

talk:
Alright. But consider my offer.

back:
You want to...
!shock
Oh... you want me to join you. Is that even possible?
Is there still a place in your life for me?
@selectJob(Evil Lair)

selectJobFail:
You have no place for me in your life anymore Violet.
Someone else lives in your lair.

apology:
!thoughtful
Mistakes? You think that’s enough to undo the damage you caused?
!sad
I... prayed for you, Violet. Believed in you.
I thought we’d make the world better together.
!neutral
?But now? I’m not sure I believe anything anymore.
[reason] I never asked for your faith.
[help] I still want to make things right.

reason:
!angry
No, you didn’t. But that doesn’t make what you did any less cruel.
You used me. And now? You want... what, forgiveness?
!neutral
You’re going to have to do more than just show up, Violet.
>decision

help:
!surprised
You do? After everything?
!neutral
I don’t know if I can trust you again. But maybe... maybe you can prove me wrong.
>decision

decision:
?What can I do to prove it?
[offer_help] You need help?
[walk_away] I don’t need your trust.

offer_help:
!neutral
There’s a loan office nearby.
They’re taking everything from people who are already struggling to survive.
!determined
Help me stop them, Violet.
If you’re serious about making things right, this is how you’ll start.

walk_away:
!angry
So that’s it? You haven’t changed at all.
You’ll keep running, Violet.
But one day, you won’t be able to escape what you’ve done.
