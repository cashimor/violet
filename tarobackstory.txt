Oh, hi. I’m Taro. Is there something on your mind?
?Anything specific you’d like to talk about?
[label1] What did you study?
[label2] Any hobbies?
[label3] Just stopping by.
[job] Can I offer you a job?

label1:
!neutral
I tried science, as I am curious about how the world works.
?As a kid, I’d take apart gadgets just to see if I could put them back together.
[label4] Sounds like you’ve always been curious.
[label5] Ever had any experiments go wrong?

label2:
!neutral
Hobbies? I guess I’d say puzzles.
?I like solving problems, even if I don’t always get them right. 
[label6] That’s cool. What kind of puzzles?
[label7] Does that tie into your work?

label3:
!neutral
No problem. Let me know if you need anything.

label4:
!neutral
Yeah, curiosity’s always been my thing.
But I guess it didn’t always pay off.
?I’ve had my fair share of, uh, unexpected results.
[label8] Did you blow something up?
[label9] Maybe I should stop asking before you scare me off.

label5:
!neutral
Oh, you mean disasters?
Well, there was this one time in school when I thought I’d cracked the formula for random outcomes...
But the results were, um, not great.
My calculations didn’t match reality. I guess I’m not great at probabilities.

label6:
!neutral
Mostly logic puzzles or brainteasers.
They’re like a mental warm-up, you know? Good for experiments.
They’re why I’m so methodical with my work.

label7:
!neutral
Sometimes. I guess I just like figuring out how things connect.
It’s not always straightforward, though.

label8:
!shock
Heh, not quite explosions.
!neutral
But I’ve definitely flooded a few labs with foam.
I learned a lot, though.

label9:
!neutral
Fair enough. I promise I’ll try not to break anything important here.
