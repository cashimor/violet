start:
You're here! Oh, wow, you're really here!
The Goddess said you'd come, but I didn't think —
Well, not so soon! And you look exactly how I imagined you would.
?Better, even!
[lucky] ...Lucky me.
[fetch] Can you go fetch food for me?

lucky:
Ah, forgive me! Where are my manners?
I’m Itsuki. Just Itsuki! But you already knew that, right?
The Goddess told you about me? She must have!
?She always says such nice things about me.
[mention] Yes, she mentioned you.
[fetch] Can you go fetch food for me?

mention:
She did? Really? Oh, that’s amazing! She never actually talked to me.
I always just imagined it. I—I have so many questions!
How does it feel to be chosen by the Goddess?
Do you have, like, divine powers now? Can you—uh, wait, let me guess!
?You probably don’t even know the full extent of your abilities yet!
[kill] Even before her I could kill you.
[fetch] Can you go fetch food for me?

kill:
Of course not! It’s always like that in the stories.
The chosen ones start small and then, bam! By the end, they’re unstoppable!
?Don’t worry, Violet—I’ll be your loyal companion. We’ll figure it out together.
[we] We?
[fetch] Can you go fetch food for me?

we:
Yes! I’ve been preparing for this my whole life.
I dreamed about you. I knew you’d come. We’re destined for greatness, Violet.
?You and me, changing the world together!
[change] Oh... the world will definitely change.
[fetch] Can you go fetch food for me?

change:
Oh, I've prepared everything! I’ve saved up money—lots of money—to support our quest.
?I even stocked up on supplies! I even have a bed for you to sleep in.
[kind] The Goddess said you prayed for me.
[money] Good, give me that money.
[fetch] Can you go fetch food for me?

kind:
I did. Every single day. I begged her to save you. And she did.
?You’re alive because of her. And because of me.
[thank] ...Thank you, Itsuki.
[delusional] You're delusional.

thank:
Aw...
>delusional

delusional:
You’re funny, Violet! I knew you’d have a sharp wit. 
But seriously, everything I have is yours. 
Money, supplies—whatever you need. We’ll be unstoppable.
You know... I was thinking, maybe after... we could...
well, maybe we could settle down somewhere? Together? You and me?
You’re amazing, Violet, and the Goddess brought us together for a reason.
It’s fate!
>fetch

fetch:
?Alright... I'll get some food for you. Don't go.
