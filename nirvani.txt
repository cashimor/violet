start:
Welcome to my humble abode, Violet.  
I don't know what *he* thought, but rescuing you... it took nearly everything I had.  
?I am drained now, though.  
[who] Who are you?  
[where] Where am I?  
[what] What happened?  
[leave] Can I go now?  

who:
I am Nirvani, the last goddess you may ever meet.  
Once, I was revered by many. Now, I am forgotten.  
?Except by you... and the smallest flicker of belief left in the world.  
[where] Where am I?  
[what] What happened?  
[leave] Can I go now?  

where:
This is my sanctuary, hidden in the threads of reality.  
A place where the forgotten gods fade, waiting for a chance to act.  
?I brought you here because no other realm would have you.  
[who] Who are you?  
[what] What happened?  
[leave] Can I go now?  

what:
Vaeren sought to end your life, and he would have succeeded.  
I intervened... but it cost me dearly.  
?Alaric believes you still have a purpose, Violet. Let us hope he's right.  
[who] Who are you?  
[where] Where am I?  
[leave] Can I go now?  

leave:
*Leave?* Violet, you misunderstand.  
You are here because I saved you. You are alive because of me.  
I would think you might show more... gratitude.  
But fine. I shall now bring you to the town where my last follower lives.  
Be kind to him, Violet. He may be your only ally.
