These are the source code and assets for Violet.
With a bit of luck a version of this is running on http://mosha.net/violet
where you may be able to try it out.
Any contact or use of this code is appreciated, please let me know.
Some assets may be missing from the repository, I can provide those separately.

This project would not have been possible without the following models:
* ChatGPT (plot, Javascript, HTML, CSS, game logic, map. Just not the math. Don't ask it to do math)
* Stable Diffusion aamXLAnimeMix_v10
* SUNO v3.5/v4
